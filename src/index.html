          This image entered into the “We are Millions Hackathon” was created with assistance
          by a matrix AI function that I wrote over a few months last summer. This was my first real
          success collaborating with AI techniques by first starting with a rough drawing.  I then
          generated a large matrix of options, and rendered hundreds of variations over a few days.

        <div class="text-xl mt-10">
          After selecting my favorites, I further edited and embellished, resulting
          in the final image here, selected for entry for the “Inspiring Art” bounty.

          It's inspiring to me, and hopefully to others by being an example of
          creating something unique that couldn't have been done by my illustration
          skill alone.
